For information on usage, including a sample of how to install IBM Integration Bus using IBM UrbanCode Deploy, see [How to automate IBM Integration Bus installation and deployments using IBM UrbanCode Deploy and Chef](https://www.urbancode.com/resource/how-to-automate-ibm-integration-bus-installation-and-deployments-using-ibm-urbancode-deploy-and-chef/). This plugin supports versions 9 & 10 of IBM Integration Bus (IIB). We no longer support WebSphere Message Broker (Versions 7 & 8). If you are looking for support for WebSphere Message Broker, please download a version of this plugin that is less than version 40.",

            "description": "Overview The Aspera plug-in uses the Aspera ascp (Aspera secure copy) client to upload and download files to and from an Aspera server. The Aspera ascp client uses the FASP transfer protocol, which can outperform TCP-based file transfer protocols such as FTP and HTTP. For more information about FASP transfer technology, see the [Aspera website](https://www.ibm.com/products/aspera).",
